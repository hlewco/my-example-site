          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p class="lead">My name is Heidi Lewco! Before you dig in to my dream house, I would like to tell you a few things about me. I was born and raised in the very cold province of Manitoba, with 4 brothers. My family has a little 1/2 section farm that dad plants crops on and sometimes we had livestock. At one time we had 100 laying hens, and I remeber having to risk getting my hands pecked off everytime I went to collect eggs. Not my favourite experiance growing up. Neither was all the poison ivy I got, or the severe sunburns. In my teenage years, my brothers and I always had friends over. We would go quading or boating together, and occationally get into mischief. Through my brothers is where I found the love of my life. I met Jeremy when I was just 14, and we clicked almost immediatly. We then started officially dating when I was 16, and got married on May 7th, 2022!</p>
          <p>I started my work ethic when I was about 4 picking veggies with my mom, I did that until I had my drivers. Then I started driving the veggie truck to Portage and selling veggies other people had to pick. In 2019, I believe, I started one of my most memorable jobs at Victoria Place Asissted Living. There I met the sweetest co-workers and elders, who will always have a place in my heart. Eventually, I had to find a full time job, so I applied to an add on Portage Online. That's where I found my favourite job. I started as a ventilation molder at Better Air Mfg, but after a year they promoted me to my dream job as an accountant!</p>
